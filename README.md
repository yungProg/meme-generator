Meme generator app is simple app which as the name implies generates a random
meme image without texts.

The app fetches data from local "api" (not really classified as api but acts as one 
for experimental purpose) and stores it to `state` which is then rendered for the user 
to see.

When user clicks `Get random image`, `setState` passes a random object to `state` and 
the image property which is url for the image is stored to `state` and rendered.

User has two input fields:
    ** One which puts text to the top of the image and
    ** one which puts text to the bottom
User can change font-size, font-family and color


## Limitations of this app
* Some image links are broken so you may see no image
* Texts overlayed on the image is not permanent hence upon downloading or saving the 
you will see no text on it
* There is no download button to download meme to you local device
* Text can't be dragged

This project is part of scrimba React course by Bob Ziroll. I haven't completed it but I 
thought it would be beneficial for me to try my hands on it.

Although this app is not perfect or no where near perfect, but being able to build this 
gives me joy as novice programmer. I am able to build form with controlled input. üéâ

PLEASE YOUR HONEST REVIEW/ OPINION/ RECOMMENDATION OR CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM IS ALWAYS 
WELCOME. THANKS.

ALL THE BEST WISHES TO ME AS YOUNG PROGRAMMER üôè
